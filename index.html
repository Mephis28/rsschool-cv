            ABOUT ME
          </h1>
          <p>
            I work in the Belarussian oil research center as a petroleum
            engineer. I was always fond of programming. What I like is the
            constant movement forward. Therefore, I want to change my profession
            and try myself in a new quality. My work includes a wide range of
            work from development analysis to the creation of hydrodynamic
            models of oil fields. For this I use hydrodynamic simulators:
            Eclipse, Tempest, tNavigator.
